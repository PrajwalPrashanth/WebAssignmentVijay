	<h1>Virtual Reality</h1>

	<p>
		Virtual reality (VR) is a computer technology that uses virtual reality headsets <br>or multi-projected environments,< sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, <br> to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment.<br> A person using virtual reality equipment is able to "look around" the artificial world,<br> and with high quality VR move around in it and interact with virtual features or items.<br> The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes,<br> but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.
